# java_todo

## Description

For the JUnit testing stretch exercise, I created a simple todo programme that would add todos to an array list and then retrieve them.
I set up a Junit test to test the programme's functionality.

## Reflection

I found the programme itself fairly straightforward to write, once I got used to the Java syntax. What I found more challenging was writing the 
Junit test, because the structure was unfamiliar to me and it was difficult to find simple guides online explaining how to write a basic test.
Once I understood how to create a new instance of the class in the test it became straightforward to apply the methods and check the programme
was working correctly.
